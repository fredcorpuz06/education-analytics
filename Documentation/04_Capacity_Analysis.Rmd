# Capacity Analysis

We perform an analysis of school capacity[^1]] along three dimensions:

* teacher capacity, as defined by the student-to-teacher ratio[^2],
* room capacity, as defined by the student-to-room ratio[^3], and 
* budgetary capacity, as defined by the amoung of maintenance and other operating expense (MOOE) budget per student[^4].

[^1]: We remove schools with zero of any of these capacity metrics,because we assume that schools cannot exist without teachers, rooms, or a budget (4,896 or 10.5%). Likewise, those without any capacity figures are ignored (4 or <0.01%) and are presented as blanks in geographic representations.
[^2]: Computed for 2014, due to data availability. For this initial section, we take all kinds of teacher (mobile, SPED, regular, and instructor).
[^3]: Computed for 2013, due to data availability. For this initial section, we assume full utilization of nonstandard and unused rooms.
[^4]: Computed for 2015, due to data availability. We assume full possible disbursement of these amounts.
